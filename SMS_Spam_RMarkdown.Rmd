## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Downloading dataset
```{r}
SMS_Spam_Dataset <- read.csv("./SMS_Spam_Dataset.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(SMS_Spam_Dataset)
```

## Cleaning Noisy Data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ColumnsToBeRemoved <- c("X","X.1", "X.2")
SMS_Spam <- SMS_Spam_Dataset[ , !(names(SMS_Spam_Dataset) %in% ColumnsToBeRemoved)]

```

## Changng column names and changing "ham" to "Legtimate" and "spam" to "Spam".

```{r}
names(SMS_Spam) <- c("Message_Tag", "Message")
levels(as.factor(SMS_Spam$Message_Tag))

SMS_Spam$Message_Tag[SMS_Spam$Message_Tag == "ham"] <- "Legitimate"
SMS_Spam$Message_Tag[SMS_Spam$Message_Tag == "spam"] <- "Spam"

SMS_Spam$Message_Tag <- factor(SMS_Spam$Message_Tag)
```
